# Heart_disease_predict
Uses Logistic Regression to predict if the person has a chance of a heart attack 

### This project covers:
- Logistic Regression
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Training and Testing the model
- Model evaluation using accuracy score

### 🔍 Dataset:
Public heart disease dataset used in many ML tutorials:  
[Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/data/heart-disease.csv)

### 🧠 Learning Note:
This is part of my ML learning journey. I'm focused on understanding each model and dataset step-by-step. More models (Random Forest, KNN) will be added soon.
